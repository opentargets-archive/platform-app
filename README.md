# Open Targets Platform App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/58a127ca-67c0-4cc3-b9e3-88dad47cfc7f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/platform-app/deploys)

This repository holds the new [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) web app.

It is a Single Page Application built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta) for the data fetching and management and the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) component collection.

If you are interested in the backend, you can take a look at the [GraphQL Endpoint Browser](https://api-beta-dot-open-targets-eu-dev.appspot.com/api/v4/graphql/browser) and the [GraphQL Endpoint Schema](https://api-beta-dot-open-targets-eu-dev.appspot.com/api/v4/graphql/browser).
